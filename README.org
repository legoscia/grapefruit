* The Grapefruit font
This font contains depictions of various fruit characters that were
added to Unicode in version 6.0.  The depictions were copied and
adapted from [[http://xkcd.com/388/]].

There is a web page at [[http://xn--9dbdkw.se/grapefruit/]], and the
source code lives at [[http://github.com/legoscia/grapefruit]].

* Red vs green apples
Both the comic and Unicode contain both red and green apples.
However, it's impossible to use different colours for different
glyphs, and furthermore the two fruits look exactly the same in the
comic except for the colour.  Therefore I decided to make the green
apple be a mirrored version of the red apple.
